# 🏎️ Predicting F1 Lap Times Using FastF1 and Machine Learning (Python Script Version)

This project uses the `FastF1` library to access 2025 Formula 1 race telemetry and session data. The lap times of a selected driver are analyzed and predicted using machine learning techniques — specifically using a `RandomForestRegressor`. The entire process is executed through a Python script.

---

## 📌 Features

- Retrieve the full **2025 F1 race calendar**  
- Load and analyze **driver lap data** for the selected race  
- Filter **quick laps** and extract **telemetry data**  
- Engineer features including speed, throttle, and brake inputs  
- Train a **Random Forest** model to predict lap times  
- Evaluate the model using **MAE** and **R² Score**  
- Plot actual vs predicted lap times  
- Show **feature importance**  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python  
- [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1)  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── F1_LapTime_Prediction.py      # Python script with all logic
├── README.md                     # Project documentation
└── fastf1_cache/                 # Cache directory (auto-generated by FastF1)
```

## 🔄 Script Workflow

1. **Install & Import Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install fastf1 scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
   ```

2. **Enable FastF1 Cache**
   ```python
   fastf1.Cache.enable_cache('./fastf1_cache')
   ```

3. **Load 2025 Schedule & Race Session**
   - Fetch all races and select a session (e.g., `Australian Grand Prix`)

4. **Extract Driver Lap Data**
   - Get a specific driver's (`VER` for Verstappen) lap records

5. **Clean & Preprocess Data**
   - Filter valid laps  
   - One-hot encode compound and track status  
   - Enrich with telemetry (AvgSpeed, MaxSpeed, Throttle, Brake)

6. **Train Model**
   - Use `RandomForestRegressor` to predict lap time  
   - Evaluate model performance with `MAE` and `R² Score`

7. **Visualize Results**
   - Scatter plot of actual vs predicted lap times  
   - Display feature importances

## 📈 Example Output

```
Mean Absolute Error: 0.423 seconds  
R² Score: 0.897  

Feature Importances:
AvgSpeed: 0.3125
TyreLife: 0.2243
MaxSpeed: 0.1634
Compound_Soft: 0.1182
...
```

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-laptime-prediction.git
   cd f1-laptime-prediction
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install fastf1 scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python F1_LapTime_Prediction.py
   ```

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Compare lap time predictions across different drivers  
- Include additional variables like tire wear rate, weather, or pit stop info  
- Switch to more advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM, etc.)  
- Deploy as a web app (Streamlit or Dash)
